# Description:

This Python code computes higher-order interactions such as 2-way, 3-way,â€¦,
n-way interaction coordinates and some circuits in the n-species (or loci in
genetics) case taking as input 2^n experimental measurements.  These
interactions are described in A.L Gould et al's work on [High-dimensional
microbiome interactions shape host fitness](
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1809349115); you can check the preprint on
[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/232959v4).


# Instructions:

1. To compute the above mentioned interactions insert manually experimental
   data and standard error measurements in the epistasis.py file and run.
   Currently, the program is set to work in the 5-species case, but it can be
   altered easily to analyze interactions in the n-species case.

2. This code can also compute the intervals in which the results of the above
   interactions are contained by knowing the intervals in which the starting
   measurments are contained: for instance, average measurement +/- SE.

3. Example: if each measurment w_X belongs to the interval [w_X-SE,w_X+SE],
   then our code coutputs the bounds of the interval [a,b] containing for
   instance the 2-way interaction

        w_00000+w_00011-w_00001-w_00010 . 

   Similarly, the code computes all other intervals for the various
   higher-order interactions described above.


# Dependencies:

* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/): Python interface to store and operate on
  numerical arrays
* [Itertools](https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html): Python module
  used to creat iterators

The epistasis.py file uses the code contained in the following files:


* Fourier.py: module written to compute interactions coordinates inside
  n-dimensional hypercubes, as described in equation 8 in [Epistasis and shapes
  of fitness landscapes](http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/oldpdf/A17n43.pdf)
* Circuits.py: generates all 2 and 3 dimensional circuit interactions inside
  n-dimensional hypercubes.
* Slicing.py: generates all possible contexts for circuit and interaction
  coordinates.
* Utlis.py: minor module with additional codes used in the above files.
