Suggested background for working on the code:

1. Very good knowledge of Python sequences. In particular `tuple/list/dict`
   comprehensions, generators and `yield from` idioms have been extensively
   applied to delegate a lot of data manipulation to Python.

2. Good knowledge of `NumPy`. A familiarity with tensors and slicing is
   essential to understand how the fitness projections are created. Only simple
   mathematical operators are used (inner product, matrix product).

3. Elementary knowledge of interval arithmetic.
